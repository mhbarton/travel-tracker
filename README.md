## GlobeTrekker

let's get trekkin'!
---------
## Overview
Want a way to keep track of all your trips, no matter if they are past, present, or upcoming? How about how much you have spent? Want to daydream about a new trek or even actually book it? Globetrekker has got you covered!

 üåç Globetrekker is a travel-tracking app that compiles and displays a user's data, including their past, upcoming, and pending bookings, along with the total amount they have spent on trips in the last year. It was built using a previously-supplied data set with architectural and functionality requirements set by Turing School of Software and Design, following the principals of Test Driven Development(TDD) and Object Oriented Programming(OOP).

## Project Context
I am a student in the Front-End Program at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://frontend.turing.edu/). Travel Tracker is our Mod 2 solo project, which means we have been software developers for just about 2 months! üôå

Learning Goals for this project included:      
‚úîÔ∏è Planning and writing ES6 classes (OOP)      
‚úîÔ∏è Making network requests to retrieve and manipulate data         
‚úîÔ∏è Using object and array prototype methods to manipulate data   
‚úîÔ∏è Implement best accessibility practices   
‚úîÔ∏è Robust TDD

## Future Iterations
Moving forward, and after revisiting the script to refactor for DRYness and formatting, we plan to develop features for:
- Create avatars for the users to choose from.
- Iteration 5: Agent Interaction.
- Give users an ability to link their trips together with other users.

## Dev Notes
### Wins
- Fully functional, interactive page
- Fully functional
- Smooth git workflow
- Learning how to implement a login page
- High level of accessibility

### Challenges
- Time management
- Sad paths
- Methods from classes not wanting to run in scripts
